# Sample app for testing QSPI peripheral on nrf5340-PDK

Sample app that is used to verify QSPI interface.

`nrf5340-PDK` has onboard external Serial NOR Flash memory [MX25R6435F](https://www.macronix.com/Lists/Datasheet/Attachments/7428/MX25R6435F,%20Wide%20Range,%2064Mb,%20v1.4.pdf) with 64Mb bits (8M bytes) of memory.

Since zephyr donâ€™t have support for QSPI for nrf5340 we had to provide our own support by making necessary changes to .dts files.

For changes check out: 
* [soc/arm/nordic_nrf/nrf53/Kconfig.soc](../../../soc/arm/nordic_nrf/nrf53/Kconfig.soc)
* [dts/arm/nordic/nrf5340_cpuapp_common.dtsi](../../../dts/arm/nordic/nrf5340_cpuapp_common.dtsi)

## Build and flash sample app

```
mkdir build && cd build
cmake -DBOARD=nrf5340pdk_nrf5340_cpuapp ..
make -j4
make flash
```

## Logging
In order to see log output from the board connect to the `/dev/ttyACM2` serial port:

```
sudo minicom --device /dev/ttyACM2
```
